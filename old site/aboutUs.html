        Spark Children Home, established in the year 2008 has been running with the number of 17 children. Majority of the children are victims during civil war and the remaining are the children left by family due to limited household income. These children range from 5-16 years old.
These children started living in Spark Children Home when they were around 5-11 years old. They were originally brought up by a person from village. The person was not able to take care of these kids.
Hirakaji Maharjan, a business man living in Lalitpur, Nepal took care of these Children by providing home and basic needs. However, in the long term he was financially unable to obtain such relief. Soon, a Nepali non-profit organization was founded and officially recognized the project as a children's home by the government. Hence, the "Spark Children Home" was born.  All children are in school and the oldest are in vocational orientation.
